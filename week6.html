        <h3>Improvements made..</h3>
        <p>
          During Week 6, I made notable improvements in my programming skills by creating an escape room game using Inquirer functions.
           This project not only allowed me to apply my knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js but also enhanced my proficiency in building interactive command-line applications. Additionally, I gained insights into the software development life cycle, which provided a structured approach to managing projects and delivering high-quality software products.

        <h3>Solutions that i am proud of..</h3>
        <p>
          One achievement I am proud of from Week 6 is successfully implementing the escape room game using Inquirer functions. Leveraging the power of Node.js and npm packages,
           I created an engaging and interactive zombie game experience that challenged players to navigate through a hospital. This project showcased my creativity and problem-solving skills, reinforcing my ability to develop engaging applications using command-line interfaces. <a href="https://github.com/Olliefranks/game">click here to enter the escape room..if you dare </a>

        <h3>Errors encountered..</h3>
        <p>
          In Week 6, I faced challenges while building my escape room game using Inquirer functions. Managing the game's complexity and user interactions within the command-line interface proved difficult. Additionally, implementing various game features and integrating npm packages introduced compatibility issues that required thorough testing and debugging. 
          Despite these challenges, I persisted and gained valuable insights into game development principles and command-line interface interactions.
