        <h3>Errors encountered..</h3>
        <p>
          During our self study timre while o was working on my Digital Diary project in week 3, I encountered several errors and challenges with CSS styling. One notable issue was struggling to achieve the desired layout and aesthetics for the diary interface.
           Despite my efforts to implement various CSS properties and techniques, I faced difficulties with alignment, spacing, and responsiveness across different screen sizes.

        <h3>What have i discovered..</h3>
        <p>
          During week 3, one new discovery that stood out to me was the importance of CSS specificity in styling web elements. I learned that CSS rules with higher specificity override those with lower specificity, leading to unexpected styling outcomes if not managed properly.
           This discovery prompted me to delve deeper into CSS specificity and flex-box structured approaches to styling,
           ultimately improving the consistency and efficiency of my frontend design process.
