        <h3>Errors encountered..</h3>
       <p>
        Throughout the week, I encountered a few errors that provided invaluable learning opportunities and insights into the intricacies of software engineering.
        One notable challenge arose while working with data types, where I initially struggled with type mismatches and conversion errors. Through careful debugging and research, I gained a deeper understanding of data type compatibility and the importance of proper type casting.

        <h3>What have i discovered..</h3>
        <p>In my first week at the software engineering bootcamp, I started on a journey of discovery that surpassed my expectations.
           Amoung the challenges and triumphs, I uncovered a great way of thinking that laid the groundwork for my growth as a programmer. First and foremost, I discovered the power of perseverance in the face of errors and setbacks.
            As I encountered various coding challenges and errors throughout the week, I learned that each mistake was not a roadblock but rather a stepping stone toward improvement. Embracing a mindset of continuous learning, I delved into debugging techniques, sought guidance from peers and mentors, and ultimately emerged stronger and more resilient.
